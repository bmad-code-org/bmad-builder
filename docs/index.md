# BMad Builder

**Whimsy-powered toolkit for building AI agents, workflows, and modules that actually work together.**

Build anything: a therapist who remembers your breakthroughs, a tax workflow that finds deductions TurboTax misses, a fitness coach that evolves with you, or tools to manage your life, business, and creativity. **Workflows are the SaaS of the future — build them, use them, sell them.**

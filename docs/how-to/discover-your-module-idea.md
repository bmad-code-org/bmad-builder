description: Find the perfect module idea by exploring your problems, expertise, and opportunities
---

Use this guide to discover what BMad module you should build. You'll learn to identify problems, recognize opportunities, and validate ideas that others will also find valuable.

:::note[Prerequisites]
- No technical skills required
- 15-30 minutes of thoughtful reflection
- Paper and pen or a notes app
:::

## When to Use This

- You're interested in building a module but don't know what to build
- You have a vague idea but need to clarify the specifics
- You want to ensure your module solves a real problem
- You're looking for ideas that could be valuable to others

## When to Skip This

- You already have a clear, specific module concept in mind
- You're building a module for a well-defined team need
- You're following the tutorials with example ideas

## Why This Matters

**The best modules solve real problems.**

BMad can build modules for ANY domain — but that doesn't mean every module idea is worth building. The most successful modules:

1. **Solve a problem you actually have** — You understand the pain point deeply
2. **Leverage your unique expertise** — You know what "good" looks like
3. **Apply to others too** — If you need it, chances are others do as well

This guide helps you find that intersection.

## Step 1: Audit Your Frustrations

Start by listing things that frustrate you. Good module ideas often come from personal annoyance.

### Prompt Questions

| Category | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| **Work** | What tasks do you repeat constantly? What processes feel unnecessarily complex? What do you procrastinate on? |
| **Life** | What do you struggle to organize? What decisions do you overthink? What do you forget to do? |
| **Learning** | What did you have to learn the hard way? What do you wish someone had taught you? |
| **Expertise** | What do you know that others find confusing? What questions do you keep answering? |

### Example Frustrations → Module Ideas

| Frustration | Module Concept |
|-------------|----------------|
| "I never remember what my therapist told me" | Therapist Agent with session memory |
| "Doing my taxes is overwhelming" | Tax Workflow with personalized deduction hunting |
| "I can't keep track of my novel's characters" | Story Architect Module with character bibles |
| "I forget workout progress" | Fitness Coach Module that remembers and evolves |
| "Legal documents are intimidating" | Legal Office Module that explains and drafts |

Write down everything — no idea is too small or weird.

## Step 2: Map Your Expertise

What do you know that others might not? Your modules will be better when they draw on your deep knowledge.

### Expertise Categories

| Type | Examples | Module Potential |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Professional** | Lawyer, doctor, accountant, teacher | Domain-specific workflows and agents |
| **Hobby** | Cooking, gaming, gardening, music | Specialized tools and guides |
| **Life Experience** | Parenting, relationships, relocation | Navigational aids and coaching |
| **Creative** | Writing, art, photography | Creative process assistants |

### Prompt: Your Expertise Audit

List 3-5 areas where you have above-average knowledge:

1. _______________ (what problems do people face in this area?)
2. _______________ (what mistakes do beginners make?)
3. _______________ (what could be streamlined?)
4. _______________ (what repetitive tasks exist?)
5. _______________ (what's missing from existing tools?)

## Step 3: Find the Intersection

The sweet spot is where **your frustrations** and **your expertise** overlap.

### The Module Idea Matrix

| | Low Frustration | High Frustration |
|---|---|---|
| **High Expertise** | **Niche Expert Tools** — Help others do what you do easily | **Premium Modules** — Solve problems you know deeply AND hate |
| **Low Expertise** | **Passion Projects** — Learn while building | **Avoid** — Hard to build well, unclear if valuable |

**Focus on High Expertise + High Frustration** — these make the best modules.

### Example: Personal Trainer

| | Low Frustration | High Frustration |
|---|---|---|
| **High Expertise** | Workout builder (easy for them, valuable to others) | **Fitness Coach Module** (solves their own tracking frustration + uses their expertise) |
| **Low Expertise** | Meal planning app (fun to learn) | Tax prep module (hard, not their domain) |

## Step 4: Validate With the "Three Questions"

Before committing to an idea, test it with three questions:

### Question 1: Is This Specific Enough?

**Too vague:** "A cooking module"
**Just right:** "A Meal Planning Module that generates weekly grocery lists based on dietary restrictions, pantry inventory, and family preferences"

**Narrow your scope until you can describe what the module DOES in one sentence.**

### Question 2: Would I Use This Weekly?

If you wouldn't use it regularly, why would anyone else?

**Be honest:** Is this a "nice to have" or a "must have" for you?

### Question 3: Could 100 Other People Use This?

You don't need a mass market, but you need enough users to make building worthwhile.

**Good signals:**
- Friends/colleagues have the same problem
- Online communities discuss this frustration
- Existing solutions are expensive or inadequate

## Step 5: Choose Your Module Type

Based on your idea, choose the best starting point:

| If You Want To... | Start With |
|-------------------|------------|
| Automate a repetitive task | **Agent** — Simple or Expert depending on complexity |
| Guide someone through a process | **Workflow** — Step-by-step facilitation |
| Share a complete solution | **Module** — Multiple agents + workflows |

### Module Type Examples

| Idea | Best Starting Point | Why |
|------|---------------------|-----|
| "Generate better commit messages" | **Simple Agent** | Focused task, no memory needed |
| "Help me write my novel" | **Expert Agent** | Ongoing project, needs context |
| "Guide me through brainstorming" | **Workflow** | Process-oriented, doesn't need memory |
| "Complete legal office suite" | **Module** | Multiple components, complex system |

## What You Get

After completing this guide, you'll have:

- **3-5 validated module ideas** ranked by your interest and expertise
- **Clarity on the problem** your module will solve
- **Confidence in market need** based on your own experience
- **A starting point** (agent, workflow, or full module)

You'll be ready to move to:
- **[Create a Custom Agent](docs/tutorials/create-custom-agent.md)** — If you chose agent
- **[Create Your First Workflow](docs/tutorials/create-your-first-workflow.md)** — If you chose workflow
- **[Create Your First Module](docs/tutorials/create-your-first-module.md)** — If you chose module

## Example: From Frustration to Module

**Sarah's Journey:**

1. **Frustration:** "I'm a therapist and I can never remember what clients told me last session"
2. **Expertise:** Clinical psychology, session documentation, treatment planning
3. **Intersection:** High expertise (therapist) + High frustration (session tracking)
4. **Specific Idea:** "Therapist Agent that records session notes, remembers client goals, tracks progress over time"
5. **Validation:**
   - Specific? Yes — session memory and progress tracking
   - Would she use it? Weekly, every session
   - Could 100 others use it? Yes, every therapist she knows
6. **Starting Point:** Expert Agent (needs persistent memory for client data)

**Result:** Sarah builds a Therapist Agent that becomes her practice's backbone — then publishes it to the BMad marketplace where hundreds of therapists discover and use it.

## Tips

**Start small.** Your first module should solve ONE problem well, not ten problems poorly.

**Build for yourself first.** If you genuinely need and use your module, others will too.

**Document everything.** As you build, note what works and what doesn't — this becomes your module's documentation.

**Iterate publicly.** Share early versions with friends or communities. Feedback shapes better modules.

**Think ecosystem, not competition.** Your "Therapist Agent" could complement someone else's "Clinical Notes Module." Collaboration beats competition.

## Next Steps

Once you have your module idea:

1. **Choose your tutorial:** Agent, Workflow, or Module creation
2. **Create your module brief** (for modules): Run `[PB]` with Morgan to formalize your vision
3. **Build incrementally:** Start with the minimum viable version, then enhance based on use
4. **Share your work:** Publish to npm or the upcoming BMad marketplace

:::tip[No Perfect Ideas]
You don't need a perfect idea to start. You need a problem you care about solving. Your module will evolve as you build and use it. Start, then improve.

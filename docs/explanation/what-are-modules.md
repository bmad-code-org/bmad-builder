Modules are bundles of agents, workflows, and configuration that solve specific problems or address particular domains. Think of them like plugins or extensions. They are packaged capabilities you can install to extend what's possible.

## What Is a Module?

A module is a self-contained package that includes:

- **Agents**: Specialized AI assistants with specific roles
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step processes for accomplishing tasks
- **Configuration**: Module settings and variables
- **Documentation**: Usage guides and reference

When you install a module, all its agents and workflows become available as commands.

## Official Modules

:::note[Core is Always Installed]
The Core module comes pre-installed with every BMad installation and provides the foundation that other modules build upon.
:::

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Core** | Global configuration, common workflows (Brainstorming, Party Mode), shared tasks |
| **BMM** (Method) | Software and game development: planning, implementation agents, architecture |
| **BMB** (Builder) | Creating custom agents, workflows, and modules |
| **CIS** (Creative Intelligence) | Innovation, creativity techniques, storytelling, ideation |
| **BMGD** (Game Dev) | Game design workflows, narrative development, performance testing |

## Custom Modules

You can create your own modules for your domain. This includes team-specific workflows, organizational agents, and custom configurations. Custom modules install the same way as official modules.

## Installing Modules

Choose which modules to install during setup, or add/remove modules later by re-running the installer. See [Installation Guide](docs/how-to/install-custom-modules.md) for details.
